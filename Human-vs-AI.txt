The most exciting Hampi trip is a whirlwind adventure beginning with an overnight arrival in Hospet, immediately launching into a cab-driven, history-packed first day that showcases the dramatic scale and beauty of the Vijayanagara Empire's ruins. The excitement peaks at the Vijaya Vitthala Temple where the architectural marvel of the Stone Chariot and the acoustic wonder of the Musical Pillars come alive, swiftly followed by a thrilling coracle ride on the Tungabhadra River, offering a unique, water-level view of the ancient landscape. The journey continues with an adventurous, albeit challenging, ascent of 575 steps up Anjanadri Hills—the mythical birthplace of Hanuman—to capture a breathtaking panoramic vista of the boulder-strewn terrain, solidifying the trip's status as a perfect mix of cultural awe and outdoor exploration.

If you are looking for a quick weekend getaway to an exciting and adventurous place, then Hampi in Karnataka is the place to go. We planned the entire trip just a few days ago and manoeuvred through the ancient city without knowing Hindi or Kannada.

Our sightseeing started on a Friday morning. We had booked a cab through Sri Sai Tours & Travels. We started our trip at 8.30 am. The first place to visit was Virupaksha Temple. It is an ancient temple with a beautiful pond and distinct architecture. Near to that is Hemakuta Hill Temple. You would be awestruck visiting this group of Hampi monuments. They are located on a hilly terrain with several small temples along the way, leading to the double-story pavilion. It is a great place to meditate... and the serenity would engulf your wandering thoughts.
